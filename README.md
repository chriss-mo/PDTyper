## PD Typer

### Initial Prototype (4 sentences each)
1. What have you done so far? 
So far we have created a visualization that shows the difference in typing speed between people with and without parkinsons. We have an animation that plays and shows the difference in typing speed by showing the keys pressed and the words being typed out in real time along with a progress bar to further emphasize the difference. The animation also has a stop button so that it can be reset or canceled anytime. We allow for custom input as well so that the text shown visually can be changed whenever.

2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
